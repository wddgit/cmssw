# The following test checks that the expected run, lumi and event
# transitions occur as the Framework processes the file.
# It also checks that run, lumi and event numbers delivered from the
# Run, Lumi and Event objects have the expected values.
# The test depends on the content of the input files. These
# input files are created by the createEDM4hepFile.py script
# called above. createEDM4hepFile.py is a script from the
# external repository named EDM4hep. We have no control over
# that repository. If we update the version of EDM4hep and
# createEDM4hepFile.py has changed, then this test may fail.
# If that happens, then we will need to update the expected
# values in the testPodioSource_cfg.py file.
